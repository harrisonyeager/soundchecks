# Task: Database Schema Creation

Create Prisma schema definitions for Artist, Venue, and Concert entities with proper relationships and indexes. Add concertId field to existing ConcertLog table to establish relationship without renaming.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Concert model created with relationships to Artist and Venue
- [ ] ConcertLog updated with optional concertId field
- [ ] Proper indexes added for performance
- [ ] Unique constraints prevent duplicate concerts (artist + venue + date)
- [ ] Migration generated and tested locally

## Technical Details
