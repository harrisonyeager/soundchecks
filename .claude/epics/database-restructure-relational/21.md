# Task: E2E Testing for Database Restructure Epic

## Description
Write focused E2E tests using Playwright to verify the complete database restructure functionality through real user workflows. Tests should use real services (database, auth, APIs) with no mocking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] E2E test for creating concerts with duplicate detection
- [ ] E2E test for artist/venue autocomplete with fuzzy matching
- [ ] E2E test for searching concerts with normalized data
- [ ] E2E test for backward compatibility with existing concert logs
- [ ] E2E test for smart search using entity matching
- [ ] Performance validation: autocomplete responds <100ms
- [ ] All tests run against real database and services

## Technical Details
- Use Playwright for all tests
- Test against localhost:3000 with real services
- No mocking - use actual database, Clerk auth, and APIs
- Focus on critical user paths only
- Keep test count minimal but comprehensive (10-15 tests max)
- Tests should be verbose for debugging

## Dependencies
- [ ] All features implemented (issues 13-20)
- [ ] Dev server running on localhost:3000
- [ ] Database migrated with test data
- [ ] Clerk auth configured

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] Tests run in CI pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms autocomplete)
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and clear
