# Task: Entity Matching and Deduplication Service

## Description
Build service layer for entity matching using fuzzy string matching algorithms to prevent duplicate artists and venues. Implement confidence scoring and alias resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fuzzy matching service using Levenshtein distance
- [ ] Confidence scoring for match quality (0-100%)
- [ ] Alias resolution for common variations
- [ ] Service handles artist name matching
- [ ] Service handles venue name + location matching
- [ ] Configurable similarity thresholds
- [ ] Performance optimized for autocomplete (<100ms)

## Technical Details
- Create lib/services/entity-matcher.ts
- Use fast-levenshtein or similar library
- Implement caching for recent searches
- Handle special characters and case variations
- Consider location proximity for venues
- Write comprehensive unit tests

## Dependencies
- [ ] Install fuzzy matching library (fast-levenshtein)
- [ ] Database schema available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Service implemented with TypeScript
- [ ] Unit tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation written
- [ ] Code reviewed
