# Stream F: Concert POST Endpoint

## Scope
Implement POST /api/entities/concerts to create or find existing

## Files
- app/api/entities/concerts/route.ts (POST handler)

## Progress
- ✅ Created concerts directory structure
- ✅ Implemented POST handler with find-or-create logic
- ✅ Added Zod validation for request body (updated schema to accept date strings)
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for validation and JSON parsing
- ✅ Added consistent concert ID generation
- ✅ Tested endpoint functionality with various scenarios
- ✅ Stream completed successfully

## Implementation Details
- POST /api/entities/concerts endpoint added to existing route.ts file
- Uses find-or-create logic to check for existing concerts by artist + venue + city + date
- Returns whether concert was created or found
- Proper HTTP status codes (200 for found, 201 for created, 400 for validation errors)
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed Zod validation messages

## Test Results
- ✅ Valid concert creation works correctly
- ✅ Validation errors handled properly (empty artist name)
- ✅ JSON parsing errors handled correctly
- ✅ Date normalization working as expected
