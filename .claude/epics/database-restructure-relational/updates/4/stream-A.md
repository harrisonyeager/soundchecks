# Stream A: Artist GET Endpoint

## Scope
Implement GET /api/entities/artists with search and autocomplete

## Files
- app/api/entities/artists/route.ts (GET handler)

## Progress
- ✅ Created shared types in app/lib/types/entities.ts
- ✅ Created Zod schemas in app/lib/schemas/entities.ts  
- ✅ Implemented GET /api/entities/artists endpoint
- ✅ Added search functionality with query parameter
- ✅ Implemented autocomplete mode with startsWith matching
- ✅ Added pagination (default 20 items, max 100)
- ✅ Included confidence scoring based on frequency and position
- ✅ Added proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Tested endpoint with various parameters

## Implementation Details
The endpoint supports:
- Basic search: `/api/entities/artists?q=search_term`
- Autocomplete: `/api/entities/artists?q=prefix&autocomplete=true`
- Pagination: `/api/entities/artists?page=2&limit=10`
- Combined: `/api/entities/artists?q=artist&page=1&limit=5&autocomplete=true`

Returns unique artists from ConcertLog table with pagination metadata and confidence scores.

## Testing Results
- ✅ Basic endpoint returns paginated artist list
- ✅ Search filters artists correctly (case-insensitive)
- ✅ Autocomplete mode uses startsWith matching
- ✅ Pagination works with proper metadata
- ✅ Error handling validates parameters (page >= 1, limit <= 100)
- ✅ Empty results handled gracefully

## Completion
Stream A implementation is complete and ready for review.
