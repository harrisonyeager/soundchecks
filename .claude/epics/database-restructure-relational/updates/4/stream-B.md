# Stream B: Artist POST Endpoint

## Scope
Implement POST /api/entities/artists to create or find existing

## Files
- app/api/entities/artists/route.ts (POST handler)

## Progress
- ✅ Added POST handler to artists route.ts
- ✅ Implemented find-or-create logic with case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Added Zod validation for request body using `artistCreateSchema`
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for validation errors and server errors
- ✅ Tested endpoint thoroughly with various scenarios
- ✅ Fixed duplicate function issue during implementation

## Implementation Details
- **Find-or-create logic**: Uses case-insensitive string matching against ConcertLog table
- **Response format**: Returns artist object with `created` boolean flag
- **Status codes**: 201 for created, 200 for found existing
- **Validation**: Empty names and missing fields are properly validated
- **Error handling**: Zod errors return 400, server errors return 500

## Test Results
- ✅ New artist creation: Returns 201 with `created: true`
- ✅ Existing artist lookup: Returns 200 with `created: false` 
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching: "TESTING" matches "Testing"
- ✅ Empty name validation: Returns 400 with detailed error
- ✅ Missing field validation: Returns 400 with Zod error details
