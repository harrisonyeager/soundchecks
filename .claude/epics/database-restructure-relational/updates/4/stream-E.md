# Stream E: Concert GET Endpoint

## Scope
Implement GET /api/entities/concerts to find by artist/venue/date

## Files
- app/api/entities/concerts/route.ts (GET handler)

## Progress
- ✅ Created concerts directory and route file structure
- ✅ Implemented GET endpoint with comprehensive query parameter validation
- ✅ Added support for artist, venue, and city filtering  
- ✅ Implemented date filtering with specific date and date range (from/to) support
- ✅ Added pagination with default 20 items per page
- ✅ Implemented confidence scoring based on match quality, position, and recency
- ✅ Added proper error handling for validation errors and date parsing errors
- ✅ Thoroughly tested endpoint with various filter combinations
- ✅ Verified all features work correctly including pagination, filtering, and search

## Implementation Details

### Features Delivered
- **Multi-field search**: General query parameter searches across artist, venue, and city
- **Specific filtering**: Individual filters for artist, venue, and city with case-insensitive matching
- **Date filtering**: Support for both specific dates and date ranges (dateFrom/dateTo)
- **Pagination**: Full pagination support with metadata (page, limit, total, hasNext, hasPrev)
- **Confidence scoring**: Dynamic scoring based on exact matches, position, recency, and query matching
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for validation errors and invalid date formats
- **Response validation**: All responses validated against Zod schemas

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/entities/concerts` - Search concerts with filtering and pagination
  - Query parameters: `q`, `artist`, `venue`, `city`, `date`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `page`, `limit`, `autocomplete`
  - Returns paginated list of concerts with confidence scores
  - Default limit: 20 items per page
  - Supports case-insensitive search and filtering

### Testing Results
All functionality verified working:
- ✅ Basic endpoint returns valid response structure
- ✅ Artist filtering works with confidence score boost (0.5 → 0.7)
- ✅ Venue filtering works with confidence score boost (0.5 → 0.7) 
- ✅ City filtering works with confidence score boost (0.5 → 0.6)
- ✅ General search works with higher confidence for multi-field matches (0.8)
- ✅ Date filtering works correctly
- ✅ Date range filtering works correctly  
- ✅ Pagination works with custom limits
- ✅ Response format matches schema requirements

## Notes
- Stream F has also added a POST handler to the same file for concert creation
- GET handler implementation is complete and fully functional
- All requirements from the task specification have been met
- Code follows existing patterns from the artists endpoint
