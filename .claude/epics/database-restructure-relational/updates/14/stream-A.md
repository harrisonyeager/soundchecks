# Stream A: Core Matching Service - COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the complete core matching service with Levenshtein distance and confidence scoring for Issue #14.

## Files Created

### 1. `/lib/types/matcher.types.ts`
- Comprehensive type definitions for matching system
- Configuration interfaces with weights and thresholds
- Result types with detailed confidence breakdowns
- Default configuration constants

### 2. `/lib/services/matchers/levenshtein.ts`
- Wrapper around fast-levenshtein library
- String similarity calculation (0-100%)
- Normalization for consistent comparisons
- Performance-optimized matching functions
- Support for case-sensitive/insensitive matching

### 3. `/lib/services/matchers/confidence-scorer.ts`
- Multi-factor confidence scoring system
- Weighs exact matches, fuzzy matches, and alias matches
- Detailed confidence breakdowns
- Threshold checking and comparison utilities
- Batch scoring capabilities

### 4. `/lib/services/entity-matcher.ts`
- Main coordinating service class
- Artist and venue matching with city filtering
- Performance monitoring (<100ms target)
- Autocomplete and precision configuration presets
- Batch processing capabilities
- Configurable similarity and confidence thresholds

## Dependencies Added

- `fast-levenshtein: ^3.0.0` - High-performance Levenshtein distance calculation
- `@types/fast-levenshtein: ^0.0.4` - TypeScript definitions

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Performance Optimized**: Target <100ms response time for autocomplete  
✅ **Configurable Thresholds**: Similarity and confidence can be adjusted  
✅ **Multiple Match Types**: Exact, fuzzy, and alias matching  
✅ **Detailed Scoring**: Confidence breakdowns with weighted factors  
✅ **City Filtering**: Venue matching with optional city constraints  
✅ **Batch Operations**: Support for multiple queries at once  
✅ **Edge Case Handling**: Null/undefined/empty string protection  
✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces  

## Configuration Presets

- **Autocomplete Config**: Fast, lower thresholds (min 50% similarity, 60% confidence, 5 results)
- **Precision Config**: Accurate, higher thresholds (min 70% similarity, 80% confidence, 20 results)
- **Default Config**: Balanced settings (min 60% similarity, 70% confidence, 10 results)

## Performance Characteristics

- String normalization with punctuation removal
- Early exits for obvious matches/mismatches  
- Levenshtein distance calculation only when needed
- Memory-efficient batch processing
- Performance warnings when exceeding 100ms

## Code Quality

- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable utility functions
- TypeScript strict mode compatible

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All requirements from Stream A have been fully implemented:
- ✅ fast-levenshtein dependency added and installed
- ✅ lib/services/entity-matcher.ts main service created
- ✅ lib/services/matchers/levenshtein.ts wrapper created  
- ✅ lib/services/matchers/confidence-scorer.ts scorer created
- ✅ lib/types/matcher.types.ts interfaces defined
- ✅ Performance optimized for <100ms response
- ✅ Configurable similarity thresholds implemented
- ✅ Full TypeScript implementation with proper types
- ✅ Edge case handling implemented
- ✅ Code committed with proper message
