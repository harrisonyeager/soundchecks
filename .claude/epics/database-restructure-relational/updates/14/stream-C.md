# Stream C: Alias Resolution System - COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the complete alias resolution system with comprehensive text normalization and fuzzy matching capabilities for Issue #14.

## Files Created

### 1. `/lib/data/common-aliases.ts`
- Comprehensive database of common artist aliases (Prince, GNR, RHCP, etc.)
- Venue abbreviations and common names (MSG, Radio City, The Garden)
- City/location aliases (NYC, LA, SF, etc.)
- Reverse lookup capabilities for canonical names
- Category-specific alias retrieval functions
- Over 100+ pre-defined aliases across all categories

### 2. `/lib/services/matchers/text-normalizer.ts`
- Advanced text normalization for consistent matching
- Accent and diacritic removal (café → cafe)
- Unicode to ASCII conversion with comprehensive mapping
- Punctuation and special character normalization
- Case-insensitive processing
- Article removal (a, an, the)
- Stop word filtering capabilities
- Whitespace normalization
- Multiple normalization variations generator
- Levenshtein-based similarity calculation

### 3. `/lib/services/alias-resolver.ts`
- Main alias resolution service with fuzzy matching
- Confidence scoring for alias matches (0-100%)
- Support for custom alias additions at runtime
- Batch resolution capabilities with summary statistics
- Category-specific resolution (artist, venue, city)
- Performance-optimized alias lookups
- Comprehensive suggestion system for partial matches
- Integration with existing matcher.types.ts interfaces

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Comprehensive Alias Database**: 100+ pre-defined aliases for artists, venues, and cities  
✅ **Advanced Text Normalization**: Handles accents, unicode, punctuation, and case variations  
✅ **Fuzzy Alias Matching**: Similarity-based matching with configurable thresholds  
✅ **Dynamic Alias Management**: Add/remove custom aliases at runtime  
✅ **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed confidence metrics for all matches  
✅ **Batch Processing**: Resolve multiple aliases with performance summaries  
✅ **Category Filtering**: Artist, venue, or city-specific resolution  
✅ **Suggestion System**: Provides alternatives for unresolved terms  
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Map-based lookups with normalized keys  
✅ **TypeScript**: Full type safety with existing interfaces  
✅ **International Support**: Handles accents, diacritics, and unicode characters  

## Alias Categories

### Artists (50+ aliases)
- Rock bands: GNR → Guns N' Roses, RHCP → Red Hot Chili Peppers
- Hip-hop: Eminem/Slim Shady, Jay-Z/Hov, Biggie/Notorious B.I.G.

## Text Normalization Features

- **Accent Removal**: café → cafe, naïve → naive
- **Unicode Conversion**: Cyrillic, Eastern European characters
- **Punctuation Handling**: Smart removal while preserving meaning
- **Case Normalization**: Consistent lowercase processing
- **Whitespace Handling**: Trim and collapse multiple spaces
- **Article Removal**: "The Beatles" → "Beatles" (configurable)
- **Stop Word Filtering**: Optional removal of common words

## Performance Characteristics

- Map-based O(1) exact lookups
- Efficient fuzzy matching with early termination
- Batch processing with summary statistics
- Memory-efficient custom alias storage
- Configurable similarity thresholds (default 60%)
- Suggestion generation for partial matches

## Code Quality

- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Clean separation of concerns across files
- Extensive edge case handling
- Reusable utility functions
- Compatible with existing matcher system

## Integration Points

- Uses existing `MatchConfig` and `MatchResult` interfaces
- Compatible with `DEFAULT_MATCH_CONFIG` settings
- Integrates with confidence scoring system
- Works with entity matcher performance targets
