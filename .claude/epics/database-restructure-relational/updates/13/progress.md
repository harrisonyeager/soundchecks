# Issue #13: Database Schema Creation - Progress

## Current Status
Work has begun on implementing the database schema changes with two parallel streams completed.

## Stream Progress

### Stream A: Migration Setup & Schema Updates
- **Status**: Completed by parallel agent
- **Work Done**: 
  - Created complete Prisma schema with Artist, Venue, and Concert models
  - Added optional concertId field to ConcertLog for normalized relationships
  - Implemented proper indexes and unique constraints
  - Provided migration commands ready to execute

### Stream B: Migration Testing & Validation  
- **Status**: Pending (waiting for Stream A completion)
- **Scope**: Test migrations, validate schema changes, verify rollback procedures

### Stream C: Documentation & Type Generation
- **Status**: Completed by parallel agent
- **Work Done**:
  - Researched existing schema structure and entity types
  - Prepared comprehensive database migration documentation
  - Prepared README database setup instructions
  - Type generation planning completed

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- ✅ Artist model created with core fields (name, aliases array, imageUrl)
- ✅ Venue model created with location fields (name, aliases, city, country, coordinates)
- ✅ Concert model created with relationships to Artist and Venue
- ✅ ConcertLog updated with optional concertId field
- ✅ Proper indexes added for performance
- ✅ Unique constraints prevent duplicate concerts (artist + venue + date)
- ⏸️ Migration generated and tested locally (pending Stream B)
- ✅ Rollback procedure documented
- ⏸️ Schema validated with Prisma Studio (pending Stream B)
- ⏸️ Code reviewed (pending completion)

## Technical Implementation

### Schema Structure Created
- **Artist Model**: id, name, aliases[], imageUrl with proper indexes
- **Venue Model**: id, name, aliases[], city, country, latitude, longitude with location indexes
- **Concert Model**: id, artistId, venueId, date with unique constraint and relationship indexes
- **ConcertLog Update**: Added optional concertId field with SetNull referential action

### Key Features Implemented
- Cascade delete rules for data integrity
- Composite unique constraint on (artistId, venueId, date)
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for query performance
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing ConcertLog data

## Next Steps
1. Execute Stream B for migration testing and validation
2. Run migration commands in development environment
3. Validate schema with Prisma Studio
4. Complete code review
