# Task: Backward Compatibility Layer

## Description
Ensure existing API endpoints and features continue working with both old (string-based) and new (entity-based) data models during the transition period.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing /api/concerts endpoint handles both formats
- [ ] Profile concert display works with mixed data
- [ ] Feed shows concerts regardless of data model
- [ ] Search functionality spans both models
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing URLs
- [ ] Adapter pattern implemented for data translation
- [ ] Performance not degraded

## Technical Details
- Create lib/adapters/concert-adapter.ts
- Modify existing API routes for compatibility
- Add data model detection logic
- Transform responses to consistent format
- Use feature flag for gradual rollout
- Monitor performance impact

## Dependencies
- [ ] Entity APIs available
- [ ] Database schema updated

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Compatibility layer implemented
- [ ] Existing features tested
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Migration path documented
- [ ] Code reviewed
