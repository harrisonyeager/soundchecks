# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #14

## Overview
Build a comprehensive entity matching and deduplication service that uses fuzzy string matching algorithms to prevent duplicate artists and venues in the database. The service will provide confidence scoring, alias resolution, and optimized performance for autocomplete functionality.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core Matching Service
**Scope**: Implement the base matching algorithms and confidence scoring logic
**Files**:
- `lib/services/entity-matcher.ts`
- `lib/services/matchers/levenshtein.ts`
- `lib/services/matchers/confidence-scorer.ts`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Artist & Venue Specialization
**Scope**: Implement specialized matching logic for artists and venues
**Files**:
- `lib/services/matchers/artist-matcher.ts`
- `lib/services/matchers/venue-matcher.ts`
- `lib/services/matchers/location-utils.ts`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: none (interfaces can be defined independently)

### Stream C: Alias Resolution System
**Scope**: Build alias management and common variation handling
**Files**:
- `lib/services/alias-resolver.ts`
- `lib/data/common-aliases.ts`
- `lib/services/matchers/text-normalizer.ts`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream D: Caching & Performance
**Scope**: Implement caching layer and performance optimizations
**Files**:
- `lib/services/cache/matcher-cache.ts`
- `lib/services/cache/lru-cache.ts`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs core service interface)

### Stream E: Testing Suite
**Scope**: Comprehensive unit tests and performance benchmarks
**Files**:
- `lib/services/__tests__/entity-matcher.test.ts`
- `lib/services/__tests__/artist-matcher.test.ts`
- `lib/services/__tests__/venue-matcher.test.ts`
- `lib/services/__tests__/performance.bench.ts`
**Agent Type**: test-specialist
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B complete
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
The following files need coordination between streams:
- `lib/types/matcher.types.ts` - Streams A, B, C (shared type definitions)
- `package.json` - Stream A (add fast-levenshtein dependency)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Core matching interface (Stream A) before caching layer (Stream D)
2. Matching implementations (A, B) before comprehensive tests (Stream E)
3. Type definitions should be established early by Stream A

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on mostly independent modules
- **Medium Risk**: Type definition file shared between streams, but manageable with clear interfaces
- **Low Risk**: Each stream has clearly defined boundaries and minimal overlap

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A, B, and C simultaneously as they can work independently. Stream D starts when A completes. Stream E starts when A and B complete.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 3.5 hours (A completes in 3h, then D in 1.5h, E runs partially in parallel)
- Total work: 11 hours
- Efficiency gain: 68%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 11 hours

## Notes
- Consider using TypeScript interfaces early to establish contracts between streams
- The caching layer (Stream D) is critical for meeting the <100ms performance requirement
- Venue matching should consider geographic proximity, which may require additional geolocation utilities
- Test data should include edge cases: accented characters, abbreviations, common misspellings
- Consider implementing a configuration system for threshold tuning without code changes
