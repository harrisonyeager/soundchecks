# Project Brief

## Executive Summary
SoundChecks is a social platform that enables music fans to log, share, and discover live concert experiences. By combining personal concert tracking with social networking features, it creates a vibrant community centered around live music experiences.

## Project Scope

### What It Is
- **Personal concert diary** for tracking live music experiences
- **Social network** for music fans to connect and share
- **Discovery platform** for finding new artists and venues
- **Community hub** for concert-goers and music enthusiasts

2. **Builds History**: Create comprehensive concert attendance records
3. **Enables Sharing**: Share experiences with followers
